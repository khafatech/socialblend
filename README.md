Cal Poly hackathon 2014



What works (as of 8 Feb 2014)

- Display list (image/link/text) of most popular instagram posts

- search instagram by one tag.

- clicking on a "Category" searches for corresponding tag.


So far this is mostly proof of concept to learn angularjs, how to use rest API's, authentication methods (Open Auth2).
