## Things add and improve


- rethink point of this webpage
	- for experience, to test web technologies
	- useful? (navigate reddit/imgur easier.) canvas / graph traversal?



- remove duplication in instagram retrieval

- add retrieval process through angular services


- "streamline" integration with ui elements
	* search bar should search multiple tags? (like fb's tag people)

- rewrite html/css using bootstrap & bootswatch & jquery plugins

- add transitions? (angular routes, multiple views)

- add relevant posts?

- find out how to add popup boxes




## 9 Feb 2014 "Hackathon day"

* 9:10am

	+ make git repo
	+ make dropbox folder


* By 11am:
	- get posts from twitter and insta

* 11:30am
	- order/blend posts

### From here, what happened:

* using the Twitter api took a lot more time because of the CORS problem. The web browser sent an OPTION HTTP method instead of POST and twitter didn't accept it. Workarounds to disable CORS in angular/the python server didn't work.

* Started getting instagram posts at ~3-4pm. Was much easier since a request is only one GET.
